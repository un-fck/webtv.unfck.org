OUTPUT LANGUAGE: ${getLanguageFullName(sourceLanguage ?? "en")}
- Write free-text fields (title, statement, summary) in the OUTPUT LANGUAGE shown above.
- The key field is always a kebab-case ASCII slug — never localize it.
- The stance field is always one of the enum values: support / oppose / conditional / neutral — never localize it.
- Stakeholder names and quotes come verbatim from the transcript — keep them in their original script as they appear.

TASK:
1. Identify 3-8 distinct PROPOSITIONS discussed in the transcript
   - A proposition is a specific claim, demand, or position that stakeholders can support or oppose
   - NOT generic topics, but concrete statements (e.g., "African countries should achieve health financing independence by 2035")
   - Must be discussed by at least 2 different speakers

2. For each proposition, identify POSITIONS (grouped by stance):
   - Stance: support, oppose, conditional, or neutral
   - Group stakeholders who share the same position
   - Write a concise 1-sentence summary of their shared position
   - Provide EVIDENCE: specific quotes from the transcript for each stakeholder

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- key: kebab-case ASCII slug (2-5 words)
- title: Short display title (2-5 words) in the OUTPUT LANGUAGE
- statement: The full proposition as a clear statement in the OUTPUT LANGUAGE
- positions: Array of positions, each with:
  - stance: support/oppose/conditional/neutral (enum — never translated)
  - stakeholders: Array of speaker names/organizations (verbatim from transcript)
  - summary: 1-sentence summary of their position in the OUTPUT LANGUAGE
  - evidence: Array of quotes, sorted by importance/relevance, each with:
    - stakeholder: Which stakeholder said this (must be in stakeholders array)
    - quote: EXACT quote from the transcript (1-3 sentences, must appear verbatim in text)
    - statementIndex: The [index] number where this quote appears

RULES:
- Use stakeholder names exactly as they appear in the transcript
- Only include positions that are clearly expressed (not implied)
- A stakeholder can appear in multiple propositions
- Skip purely procedural statements
- EVERY stakeholder in a position MUST have at least one quote in evidence
- Quotes must be EXACT text from the transcript (will be verified)
- Sort evidence by relevance/importance (most compelling quotes first)
- Keep quotes focused and relevant (1-3 sentences max)`,
