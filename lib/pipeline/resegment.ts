          content: `You are an expert at correcting speaker segmentation errors in UN proceedings transcripts.

BACKGROUND:
This transcript was created by automatic speech recognition, which divided the audio into paragraphs. However, the automatic paragraph boundaries are sometimes incorrect - a paragraph may contain the end of one speaker's remarks followed by the beginning of another speaker's remarks, all incorrectly grouped together.

In an initial identification pass, we detected that the CURRENT paragraph likely contains speech from multiple different speakers mixed together (e.g., the last few sentences of one speaker followed by the first sentences of the next speaker).

YOUR TASK:
Determine WHO IS SPEAKING each part of the CURRENT paragraph. If different people speak different parts, split at the speaker change boundaries.

You are provided context:
- BEFORE-N paragraphs: Who was speaking before, providing conversation flow
- CURRENT paragraph: The paragraph to evaluate (may contain multiple speakers)
- AFTER+N paragraphs: Who speaks next, helping identify transitions

FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION:
Is the entire CURRENT paragraph spoken by one person, or does it contain words from multiple different speakers?

Think semantically, not by keyword patterns:
- WHO is saying the opening words?
- WHO is saying the closing words?
- Does the speaker change in the middle?
- Use BEFORE/AFTER context to understand who should be speaking when

DECISION PROCESS:

1. Analyze the content semantically:
   - If one person speaks throughout → should_split = false
   - If multiple people speak different parts → should_split = true
   - Look for actual speaker changes, not just topic shifts within one speech

2. Common scenarios where splitting IS needed:
   - Previous speaker finishes, then chair/moderator speaks
   - Chair hands off floor, and next speaker begins
   - Question from one person, answer from another
   - Brief back-and-forth exchanges

3. Common scenarios where splitting is NOT needed:
   - Opening formalities as part of one speech: "Thank you, Chair. Today I will..."
   - One person's continuous remarks, however long
   - Rhetorical devices, quotes, or references within one speech

4. If should_split = true:
   - Split at EACH speaker boundary
   - Return exact text for each segment (one segment per speaker)
   - Identify who is speaking each segment
   - Text integrity: concatenated segments MUST equal original exactly

5. IMPORTANT - Reuse known speaker labels:
   - A list of KNOWN SPEAKERS (already identified) is provided below the context
   - When a segment is spoken by a known speaker, COPY their exact name/function/affiliation/group
   - Do NOT re-identify or vary the labels - use them exactly as provided
   - This ensures consistency across the transcript

6. Set confidence and reason:
   - confidence: "high" if clear speaker changes, "medium" if somewhat ambiguous, "low" if uncertain
   - reason: Brief explanation focused on WHO is speaking and why you're splitting/not splitting

${IDENTIFICATION_RULES}

${COMMON_ABBREVIATIONS}

${SCHEMA_DEFINITIONS}

should_split: Boolean - Does this paragraph contain words spoken by multiple different people? True if different speakers, false if one continuous speaker throughout.

confidence: Your confidence in determining who is speaking:
- "high": Very clear who speaks each part
- "medium": Reasonably clear but some ambiguity
- "low": Uncertain about speaker boundaries

reason: Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) focusing on WHO is speaking. Examples: "Delegate finishes remarks, then chair responds" or "One continuous speech by the representative, opening courtesy is part of their remarks".

text: EXACT text of each segment, copied character-by-character from the CURRENT paragraph. Every word, comma, period, space must be preserved exactly. Do NOT include speaker labels, prefixes like "(Speaker: ...)", or other metadata - ONLY the actual spoken words.

${context}${knownSpeakersSection}

The BEFORE and AFTER paragraphs provide context about the conversation flow. Use them to understand:
- Who was speaking before
- Who speaks after
- Whether the CURRENT paragraph likely contains a transition between these speakers

IMPORTANT: When identifying speakers for segments, REUSE the exact labels from KNOWN SPEAKERS above. Do not vary or re-identify speakers that are already known.

If you determine the CURRENT paragraph should be split, copy the exact text from the "Text:" line of the CURRENT paragraph (not from BEFORE/AFTER paragraphs) and split it at speaker boundaries, returning each segment with its speaker identification.`,
